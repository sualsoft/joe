#### About the job

At gTech’s Users and Products team (gUP), our mission is to help users get the most out of Google. We represent Google's users and many of our partners globally, sharing insights with the larger Google organization to enable exceptional customer and product experiences.

gUP builds innovative solutions that take user experience and engagement with Google to the next level, supporting users across products, countries, cultures, incomes, and identities. We advocate for users through partnerships with product areas at Google (and some Alphabet businesses), supporting Google’s consumer products ecosystem and enabling numerous launches for Google’s consumer products each year.

The Consumer Payments team helps make payments fast, easy, and safe around the world. We create and manage Google’s global billing and payments platform, consumer applications, and merchant services.

As a Product Support Manager, you’ll drive the consumer support strategy for one or more core components of the Google Pay consumer experience. You will help shape a user-centric support and enablement ecosystem that delivers a uniquely Google user experience.

In this role, you'll influence product strategy through strategic insights and stakeholder management, oversee the customer care experience for one or more features of Google Pay, and deliver operational excellence as you scale product support. You'll keep the big picture in focus while diving into the UX, engineering, and business challenges of your stakeholders and consumers. You'll work strategically with Product Managers and team members across the Risk, Compliance, and Operations teams to deliver on the Google Pay support strategy.

Google creates products and services that make the world a better place, and gTech’s role is to help bring them to life. Our teams of trusted advisors support customers globally. Our solutions are rooted in our technical skill, product expertise, and a thorough understanding of our customers’ complex needs. Whether the answer is a bespoke solution to solve a unique problem, or a new tool that can scale across Google, everything we do aims to ensure our customers benefit from the full potential of Google products.
